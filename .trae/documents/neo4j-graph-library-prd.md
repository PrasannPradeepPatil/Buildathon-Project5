# Neo4j Graph Database Library - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Product Overview
A flexible Neo4j-based graph database library that enables schema-driven database creation and provides comprehensive CRUD, search, and retrieval operations for diverse data types including text, images, audio, code, and documents.

The library serves as a unified backend foundation for multiple AI-powered applications, supporting natural language queries, semantic search, and interactive graph visualization across different domains from visual memory search to knowledge graph construction.

## 2. Core Features

### 2.1 User Roles
| Role | Registration Method | Core Permissions |
|------|---------------------|------------------|
| Developer | API Key authentication | Full access to schema creation, database operations, and configuration |
| Application User | Token-based authentication | Read/write access to specific graph instances based on application context |
| Admin | System-level credentials | Complete system management, monitoring, and multi-tenant configuration |

### 2.2 Feature Module
Our Neo4j graph database library consists of the following main components:
1. **Schema Management Interface**: Dynamic schema definition, validation, and migration tools.
2. **Database Operations Engine**: CRUD operations, batch processing, and transaction management.
3. **Search & Query Interface**: Natural language processing, semantic search, and graph traversal queries.
4. **Data Ingestion Pipeline**: Multi-format data processing, extraction, and graph construction.
5. **Visualization & Export Module**: Graph visualization, data export, and reporting capabilities.
6. **Administration Dashboard**: System monitoring, performance analytics, and configuration management.

| Administration Dashboard | Configuration Panel | Manage database connections, security settings, and application-specific configurations |

## 3. Core Process

**Developer Workflow:**
Developers start by defining a schema through the Schema Management Interface, specifying node types, relationships, and constraints relevant to their application domain. They then initialize a database instance and configure the data ingestion pipeline to process their specific data types. The library handles the transformation of raw data into graph structures, after which developers can implement search and query functionality using both programmatic APIs and natural language interfaces.

**Application User Workflow:**
End users interact with applications built on the library through natural language queries or application-specific interfaces. The system processes these queries, performs semantic search across the graph, and returns ranked results with confidence scores and contextual information.
